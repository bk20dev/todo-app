## Overview

![demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60577942/128012751-1531456b-8414-4913-b24a-7c8f544c4f4f.gif)

This time I focused on learning [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) library. I found it fantastic, as it is quite easy to use and allows me to focus on logic, not _boilerplate_ ðŸŽ‰
I also feel like I wrote more readable and universal code.

### Built With

- I can add a new task
- I can complete a task
- I can toggle between All, Active and Completed
- I can remove one or all tasks under the Completed tab
- Store the data in local storage that when I refresh the page I can still see my progress
